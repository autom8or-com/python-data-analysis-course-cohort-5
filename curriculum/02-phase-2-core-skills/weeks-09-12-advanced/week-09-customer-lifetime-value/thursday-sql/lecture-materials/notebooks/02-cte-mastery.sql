-- WEEK 9: CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE ANALYSIS - PART 2
-- Topic: CTE Mastery for CLV Calculations
-- Business Case: Multi-Stage CLV Analysis Pipeline
-- ================================================================

/*
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
1. Design multi-stage CTE pipelines for CLV analysis
2. Build RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation with CTEs
3. Create predictive CLV models using historical data
4. Implement customer cohort analysis frameworks
5. Optimize CTE performance for production queries

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Last week you learned basic CTEs. This week, we master advanced CTE
patterns specifically for Customer Lifetime Value analysis - the most
important metric for subscription businesses and e-commerce.

CLV COMPONENTS:
- Recency: How recently did the customer purchase?
- Frequency: How often do they purchase?
- Monetary: How much do they spend?
- Tenure: How long have they been a customer?
- Engagement: Are they active or churning?

FROM EXCEL TO SQL:
- Excel Multi-Sheet Workbook = SQL Multi-CTE Pipeline
- Excel Data Model = SQL CTE Chain
- Excel Power Query Steps = SQL CTE Stages

/*
RFM SEGMENTATION:
The gold standard for customer value analysis.
We'll build this step-by-step using CTEs.

PIPELINE:
1. Calculate raw metrics (R, F, M)
2. Score each dimension (1-5 scale)
3. Combine scores into segments
4. Analyze segment performance

/*
CTE PATTERNS FOR CLV ANALYSIS:

1. RFM SEGMENTATION:
   - Stage 1: Calculate raw metrics
   - Stage 2: Score each dimension
   - Stage 3: Combine into segments
   - Stage 4: Analyze performance

2. COHORT ANALYSIS:
   - Track customer groups over time
   - Measure retention and LTV by cohort
   - Identify best acquisition periods

3. PREDICTIVE CLV:
   - Historical patterns â†’ Future projections
   - Adjust for engagement status
   - Guide investment decisions

4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SEGMENTATION:
   - Combine RFM + satisfaction + behavior
   - Create precision micro-segments
   - Enable targeted marketing

BEST PRACTICES:
âœ“ Give each CTE a clear, descriptive name
âœ“ Build complexity gradually (simple â†’ complex)
âœ“ Comment each stage's business purpose
âœ“ Test each CTE independently before chaining
âœ“ Use CTEs for readability, temp tables for performance

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Identify highest-value customer segments
- Predict future revenue and churn risk
- Optimize marketing budget allocation
- Personalize customer experiences
- Track cohort performance over time

-- PRACTICE EXERCISES
-- ================================================================

/*
EXERCISE 1: Create a 4-stage CTE pipeline that:
           1. Calculates customer purchase frequency by quarter
           2. Identifies trend (increasing/stable/declining)
           3. Segments by trend + current value
           4. Recommends retention vs growth strategies

EXERCISE 2: Build a cohort retention analysis showing:
           - Month 0: Initial cohort size
           - Month 1: % who purchased again
           - Month 3: % still active
           - Month 6: % still active
           Use CTEs for each time period

EXERCISE 3: Design a "Next Best Action" recommendation system using CTEs:
           - Stage 1: Calculate customer metrics
           - Stage 2: Identify gaps (low frequency, single category, etc.)
           - Stage 3: Match gaps to actions
           - Stage 4: Prioritize by predicted revenue impact
